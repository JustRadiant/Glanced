# Mutuals
Visualize your network of mutual friends on Discord in a network graph.

## Warning ⚠️

This project uses your discord token to scan your mutual friends list. However, **never, ever, under *any* circumstances give your token to anybody** as it would give them full access to your account. Before running this program, I highly recommend reading through the code to make sure it is something you trust.

## Setup

To use Mutuals, you will need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). Then, either `git clone` this repository or [download it](https://github.com/humboldt123/mutuals/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). Navigate to it in your terminal of choice then run `npm i` to install its dependencies and `npm run start` to run it.

## Instructions

After running the program, it will ask you if you want to scan and update connections. If this is your first time running this, then answer yes. However you answer, it will open a window in your browser of the network graph. Have fun exploring it!
